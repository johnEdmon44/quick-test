# Front-end Developer Quick Test

We've designed a simple test to evaluate your proficiency in translating designs into HTML/CSS. If you can use Tailwind CSS and make minimal custom CSS changes, it's a big advantage.

## Task Description

1. Convert the provided design into HTML/CSS (Tailwind preferred).
2. There are two boxes â€“ the left one is active, and the right one is inactive. By default, the left one should be in an active state. Hovering over a box should make it active.
3. Choose a sans/sans-serif typeface similar to the design (you don't have to use the exact font).
4. Ensure the design looks good on different screen sizes. You have the flexibility to decide how to make it responsive, as long as the content is organized and easy to read.
5. Find any similar icons or slice the icon from the design. Icons can be SVG/PNG/JPG or font icons.
